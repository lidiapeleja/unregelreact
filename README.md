# UnregelApp

## Introduction

UnregelApp.com helps you to memorize the irregular German verbs, in a gameification manner.

## Context

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
.

The project was developed by Lídia Pelejà (lidiapeleja.com) back in 2019 when she did not have any professional front-end web developer experience. That is the reason why the code is rusty and dirty, the folders do not have a great structure, and the namings for each component and functions would be now probably using another wording.

But as one says: with something we need to get started :)

## TODOS

Things that I would now do differently, and if I'd have the time to fix it:

1. Using webpack pre-processor to handle the SCSS converting it to CSS.
2. Importing Bootsrap not globaly but in a base component manner.
3. Using bootstrap variables, themes in a \_overrides.scss file.
4. Using always the same notation: lowerCamelCase for Functions and Methods, and UpperCamelCase for classes and components.
5. Do not import a whole library like FontAwesome when we only need two logos.
6. Removing unnecessary code.
7. Use SASS @mixins for better styling to DRY.
8. Use more based-components elements for the web, as many are hard-coded.
9. Use linter so the code looks clean and organized.
10. When it comes to styling, I would maye not use so crazy yellow and pink palete, as is really the opposite what you expect from a game where you need to be looking at many minutes a day.
